# Abraham Ayala Personal Space
Hi! Welcome to my personal space! I am computer vision and robotics enthusiast and here you will find some pet projects that were part of the portofilio when I was studying the Udacity Self-Driving cars nanodegree.
My main area of interest is visual SLAM and sensor fusion for autonomous driving.
Enjoy!!!
